# Keylogger

A **Keylogger** is a program designed to capture and record keystrokes entered by a user on a keyboard. This repository implements a simple keylogger for educational and research purposes. **Use responsibly** and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## 🚨 Disclaimer
This software is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of this tool to capture private or sensitive data without permission is illegal and unethical. The developers are not responsible for any misuse of this tool.

---

## 📝 Features
- Logs every keystroke entered by the user.
- Runs silently in the background.
- Saves logs to a file for review.
- Cross-platform support (dependent on implementation).

---

## 🖥️ Requirements
- Python 3.x or later
- Required libraries:
  - `pynput` (for capturing keyboard events)

---

## 🔧 Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atphosphate/Keylogger.git
   cd Keylogger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. Run the keylogger:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

---

## 📂 File Structure
- **`keylogger.py`**: Main script for capturing and logging keystrokes.
- **`logs/`**: Directory where captured logs are stored (ensure this exists or modify the code to suit your needs).

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The script uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard events.
2. Each keypress is logged into a file, with special keys like `Enter` or `Space` clearly marked.
3. Logs are periodically saved into a designated directory or file.

---

## 🛠️ Customization
- **Log File Path**: Update the `log_file` variable in `keylogger.py` to change where logs are stored.
- **Timer/Intervals**: Adjust the interval for flushing logs or other time-based behavior in the script.

---

## 🛑 Stop the Keylogger
To stop the keylogger, terminate the running Python process. You can do this by:
- Pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- Using Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS) to end the Python process.

## 🛡️ Legal and Ethical Usage
This software is intended for personal or authorized testing environments. Misuse of keyloggers to intercept, log, or distribute sensitive information can lead to severe legal consequences.
